      <strong><u>UNIVERSAL PATIENT AUTHORIZATION FORM FOR FULL DISCLOSURE OF HEALTH INFORMATION FOR TREATMENT AND QUALITY OF CARE</u></strong>
    </p>

    <p>
      Laws and regulations require that some sources of personal information have a signed authorization or permission form before releasing it. Also,
      some laws require specific authorization for the release of information about certain conditions and from educational sources.
    </p>

    <u>“Of What”</u>: includes ALL YOUR HEALTH INFORMATION, INCLUDING:
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>All records and other information regarding your health history, treatment, hospitalization, tests, and outpatient care. This
          information may relate to sensitive health conditions (if any), <u>including but not limited to</u>:</strong>
      </li>
      <ul>a. Drug, alcohol, or substance abuse</ul>
      <ul>
        b. Psychological, psychiatric or other mental impairment(s) or developmental disabilities (excludes “psychotherapy notes” as
        defined in HIPAA at 45 CFR 164.501)
      </ul>
      <ul>c. Sickle cell anemia</ul>
      <ul>d. Birth control and family planning</ul>
      <ul>
        e. Records which may indicate the presence of a communicable disease or noncommunicable disease; and tests for or records of
        HIV/AIDS or sexually transmitted diseases or tuberculosis
      </ul>
      <ul>f. Genetic (inherited) diseases or tests</ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Copies of educational tests or evaluations, including Individualized Educational Programs, assessments, psychological and speech
          evaluations, immunizations, recorded health information (such as height, weight), and information about injuries or treatment.</strong>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Information created before or after the date of this form.</strong></li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      <u>“From Whom”</u> includes: <strong>All information sources</strong> including but not limited to medical and clinical sources (hospitals, clinics, labs, pharmacies,
      physicians, psychologists, etc.) including mental health, correctional, addiction treatment, Veterans Affairs health care facilities, state registries and
      other state programs, all educational sources that may have some of my health information (schools, records administrators, counselors, etc.),
      social workers, rehabilitation counselors, insurance companies, health plans, health maintenance organizations, employers, pharmacy benefit
      managers, worker’s compensation programs, state Medicaid, Medicare and any other governmental program.
    </p>
    <p>
      <u>“To Whom”</u>: For those health care providers listed in the “TO WHOM” section, your permission would also include physicians, other health care
      providers (such as nurses) and medical staff who are involved in your medical care at that organization’s facility or that person’s office, and health
      care providers who are covering or on call for the specified person or organization, and staff members or agents (such as business associates or
      qualified services organizations) who carry out activities and purpose(s) permitted by this form for that organization or person that you specified.
      Disclosure may be of health information in paper or oral form or may be through electronic interchange.
    </p>
    <p>
      <u>“Purpose”</u>: Your signature on this form does NOT allow health insurers to have access to your health information for the purpose of deciding to
      give you health insurance or pay your bills. You can make that choice in a separate form that health insurers use.
    </p>
    <p>
      <u>“Revocation”</u>: You have the right to revoke this authorization and withdraw your permission at any time regarding any future uses by giving
      written notice. This authorization is automatically revoked when you die. You should understand that organizations that had your permission to
      access your health information may copy or include your information in their own records. These organizations, in many circumstances, are not
      required to return any information that they were provided nor are they required to remove it from their own records.
    </p>
    <p>
      <u>“Re-disclosure of Information”</u>: Any health information about you may be re-disclosed to others only to the extent permitted by state and federal
      laws and regulations. You understand that once your information is disclosed, it may be subject to lawful re-disclosure, in accordance with
      applicable state and federal law, and in some cases, may no longer be protected by federal privacy law.
    </p>
    <p>
      <u>Limitations of this Form</u>: If you want your health information shared for purposes other than for treating you or you want only a portion of your
      health information shared, you need to use Form Florida AHCA FC4200-005 (Universal Patient Authorization Form For Limited Disclosure of Health
      Information), instead of this form. Also, this form cannot be used for disclosure of psychotherapy notes. This form does not obligate your health
      care provider or other person/organization listed in the “From Whom” or “To Whom” section to seek out the information you specified in
      the “Of What” section from other sources. Also, this form does not change current obligations and rules about who pays for copies of records
